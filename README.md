## what is this?

In recent years, attacks targeting the Web Application Platform have been increasing rapidly.
sisakulint is **a static and fast SAST for GitHub Actions**. 

This great tool can automatically validate yaml files according to the guidelines in the security-related documentation provided by GitHub!

It also includes functionality as a static analysis tool that can check the policies of the guidelines that should be set for use in each organization.

These checks also comply with [the Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-ci-cd-security-risks/) provided by OWASP.

It implements most of the functions that can automatically check whether a workflow that meets the [security features](https://docs.github.com/ja/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions) supported by github has been built to reduce the risk of malicious code being injected into the CI/CD pipeline or credentials such as tokens being stolen.

It does not support inspections that cannot be expressed in YAML and "repository level settings" that can be set by GitHub organization administrators.

It is intended to be used mainly by software developers and security personnel at user companies who work in blue teams. 

It is easy to introduce because it can be installed from brew.

It also implements an autofix function for errors related to security features as a lint.

It supports the SARIF format, which is the output format for static analysis. This allows [reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog?tab=readme-ov-file#sarif-format) to provide a rich UI for error triage on GitHub.

sisakulint automatically searches for YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory. The parser builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and traverses it to apply various security and best practice rules. Results are output using a custom error formatter, with support for SARIF format for integration with tools like reviewdog.

**Key components:**
- 📁 **Workflow Discovery** - Automatic detection of GitHub Actions workflow files
- 🔍 **AST Parser** - Converts YAML into a structured tree representation
- ⚖️ **Rule Engine** - Applies security and best practice validation rules
- 📊 **Output Formatters** - Custom error format and SARIF support for CI/CD integration

## Usage test
Create a file called test.yaml in the `.github/workflows` directory or go to your repository where your workflows file is located.

1. Missing Timeout Minutes for Jobs

- Error: `timeout-minutes is not set for job build; see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes for more details.`

- Scenario: If a job runs indefinitely due to an unexpected error (e.g., a script hangs), it can consume resources unnecessarily, leading to increased costs and potential service disruptions. For example, if the `build` job is stuck, subsequent jobs that depend on its completion will also be delayed, causing the entire CI/CD pipeline to stall.

2. Incorrectly Formatted Environment Variable

- Error: `Environment variable name '"SIIISA=AAKUUU"' is not formatted correctly.`

- Scenario: If environment variables are not formatted correctly, the job may fail to execute as intended. For instance, if the variable is meant to be used in a command but is incorrectly defined, it could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior, such as failing to authenticate with an external service.

3. Deprecated Command Usage

- Error: `workflow command "set-output" was deprecated.`

- Scenario: Using deprecated commands can lead to future compatibility issues. If GitHub Actions removes support for the `set-output` command, workflows relying on it will break, causing failures in automated processes. This could delay releases or lead to incomplete deployments.

4. Direct Use of `${{ ... }}` in Run Steps

- Error: `Direct use of ${{ ... }} in run steps; Use env instead.`

- Scenario: Directly using expressions in run steps can expose the workflow to script injection attacks. For example, if an attacker can manipulate the input to the workflow, they could inject malicious commands that execute during the job, potentially compromising the repository or the CI/CD environment.

5. Always True Condition

- Error: `The condition '${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}' will always evaluate to true.`

- Scenario: If conditions are not set correctly, it can lead to unintended behavior in the workflow. For instance, if the intention was to run a step only for specific events, but the condition is always true, it could result in unnecessary steps being executed, wasting resources and time.

6. Invalid Permission Scopes

- Error: `unknown permission scope "check".`

- Scenario: Using invalid permission scopes can lead to failures in accessing necessary resources. For example, if the `test` job requires write access to checks but is incorrectly defined, it may not be able to create or update checks, leading to incomplete test results and a lack of visibility into the CI/CD process.

7. Invalid Job ID

- Error: `Invalid job ID "run shell". job IDs must start with a letter or '_'.`

- Scenario: If job IDs are not valid, the workflow will fail to execute. For example, if the job `run shell` is intended to run a shell command but is not recognized due to an invalid ID, it will not run at all, potentially skipping important steps in the workflow.

8. Missing Timeout Minutes for Additional Jobs

- Error: `timeout-minutes is not set for job test; see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes for more details.`

- Scenario: Similar to the first issue, if the `test` job runs indefinitely, it can block the workflow and lead to resource exhaustion. This can delay the entire CI/CD process, affecting deployment timelines and potentially leading to missed deadlines.

      - name: Run sisakulint with reviewdog
        env:
          REVIEWDOG_GITHUB_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

          sisakulint -format "{{sarif .}}" | \
          reviewdog -f=sarif -reporter=github-pr-review -filter-mode=nofilter
```

### SARIF format usage

To output results in SARIF format:

```bash
# Output to stdout
$ sisakulint -format "{{sarif .}}"

# Save to file
$ sisakulint -format "{{sarif .}}" > results.sarif

# Pipe to reviewdog
$ sisakulint -format "{{sarif .}}" | reviewdog -f=sarif -reporter=github-pr-review
```

### Benefits in CI/CD

- ✅ **Automated security reviews** - Every PR is automatically checked
- ✅ **Early detection** - Find issues before merging
- ✅ **Clear feedback** - Developers see exactly what needs to be fixed
- ✅ **Consistent standards** - Enforce security policies across all workflows
- ✅ **Integration with existing tools** - Works with your current GitHub workflow

## Using autofix features

sisakulint provides an automated fix feature that can automatically resolve certain types of security issues and best practice violations. This feature saves time and ensures consistent fixes across your workflow files.

### Available modes

- **`-fix dry-run`**: Show what changes would be made without actually modifying files
- **`-fix on`**: Automatically fix issues and save changes to files

### Rules that support autofix

The following rules support automatic fixes:

#### 1. missing-timeout-minutes (timeout-minutes)
Automatically adds `timeout-minutes: 5` to jobs and steps that don't have it set.

**Before:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

**After:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

#### 2. commit-sha (commitsha)
Converts action references from tags to full-length commit SHAs for enhanced security. The original tag is preserved as a comment.

**Before:**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
```

**After:**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4
  - uses: actions/setup-node@60edb5dd545a775178f52524783378180af0d1f8 # v3
```

#### 3. credentials
Removes hardcoded passwords from container configurations.

**Before:**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: myregistry/myimage
      credentials:
        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        password: my-hardcoded-password
```

**After:**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: myregistry/myimage
      credentials:
        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
```

#### 4. untrusted-checkout
Adds explicit ref specifications to checkout actions in privileged workflow contexts to prevent checking out untrusted PR code.

**Before:**
```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm install
```

**After:**
```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
      - run: npm install
```

#### 5. artifact-poisoning
Adds validation steps to artifact download operations to prevent path traversal and poisoning attacks.

**Before:**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: build-output
  - run: bash ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

**After:**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: build-output
  - name: Validate artifact paths
    run: |
      # Validate no path traversal attempts
      find . -name ".." -o -name "../*" | grep . && exit 1 || true
  - run: bash ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Usage examples

#### 1. Check what would be fixed (dry-run mode)
```bash
$ sisakulint -fix dry-run
```
This will show all the changes that would be made without actually modifying your files. Use this to preview changes before applying them.

#### 2. Automatically fix issues
```bash
$ sisakulint -fix on
```
This will automatically fix all supported issues and save the changes to your workflow files.

#### 3. Typical workflow
```bash
# First, run without fix to see all issues
$ sisakulint

# Preview what autofix would change
$ sisakulint -fix dry-run

# Apply the fixes
$ sisakulint -fix on

# Verify the changes
$ git diff .github/workflows/
```

### Important notes

- **Always review changes**: Even though autofix is automated, always review the changes made to your workflow files before committing them
- **Commit SHA fixes require internet**: The `commit-sha` rule needs to fetch commit information from GitHub, so it requires an active internet connection
- **Rate limiting**: The commit SHA autofix makes GitHub API calls, which are subject to rate limiting. For unauthenticated requests, the limit is 60 requests per hour
- **Backup your files**: Consider committing your changes or backing up your workflow files before running autofix
- **Not all rules support autofix**: Some rules like `expression`, `permissions`, `issue-injection`, `cache-poisoning`, and `deprecated-commands` require manual fixes as they depend on your specific use case
- **Auto-fix capabilities**: Currently, `timeout-minutes`, `commit-sha`, `credentials`, `untrusted-checkout`, and `artifact-poisoning` rules support auto-fix. More rules will support auto-fix in future releases
